## About 

In this project, we will learn about spatial data and accessibility on the University of Pennsylvania campus. Building on existing resources, we will identify gaps in the data and make contributions to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), which is a community-driven, open data repository for data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world. .
