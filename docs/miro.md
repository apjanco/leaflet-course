# Miro boards

1. Introductions, who we are, what we do, why we're here.  
2. Read over the words on the sticky notes.
3. Move the notes around on the board to illustrate. For example, move "migration" near to Work to relate the two. You can also place one sticky note on top of another to create a stack or place it in between two areas to create a connection.
4. You can also add new sticky notes with your own words or ideas.
5. The overall goal is to talk about ourselves using the words on the sticky notes rather than familiar narratives.
