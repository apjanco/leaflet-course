## Activity:Identify participant goals and priorities for the course 
- Similar to humetrics, print out common terms for goals/outcomes.

- ask the students to sort/organize them, combine them to describe (explain wording):
    - Who I am (what words describe me)
    - What I want to learn
    - What I can share
Tell us why you chose the words that you did.
First model with myself how this works.
